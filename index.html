                            Hello!  So I am here resuming a journey I began when I was a kid.  I learned how to fix computers by intentionally breaking my own on a regular basis.  I loved everything about them, and constantly tinkered with DOS, the various operating systems I was on, and the hardware.  I was teaching myself HTML to build webpages back then as well.  I would view the source code of the pages, deleting and adding things to see how it affected the presentation.  I learned quite a bit and used that to turn what was a data entry job through a temp agency into a full time job in the IT department at that company.  I learned quite a bit there about network administration, and the IT field in general.  I got my first introduction to UNIX while working there, as well as my first experience with Apple computers.  I was fortunate enough with the timing to be able to participate in the planning and implementation of a Windows NT to Windows 2k network conversion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While I was grateful and appreciative of the opportunity I was given to learn, I wanted more.  The company I was at was relatively small, employing about 90-100 people.  The "IT department" was myself and my boss...that's it.  While they were happy to have me, and I was happy to be afforded the opportinity I had, I felt I had hit the ceiling there and decided to move on.  Looking back, I was a punk 20 year old kid with long hair and no formal education to back up what I knew I could do.I certainly had not hit the ceiling yet, and should have stayed and continued to learn and gain experience.  Hindsight is 20/20...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I did get lucky enough to land a job in the "computer room" for a printing company, but there was virtually zero IT work involved in the job.  Nonehteless, I took the job because their headquarters which contained the IT department was less than an hour from my house.  I was hoping to get hired into the department from inside the company.  Three months after I got hired, their IT department was relocated to Montreal.  I had no plans to move, so I started looking for something else.  I began bartending and waiting tables, and ended up stuck in the restaurant industry for 17 years.  I did everything under the sun in a restaurant from hosting to being the general manager.  I finally broke out about two years ago, and without finding my footing where I wanted to be, I found this coding bootcamp.  Immediately I got excited about the prospect of going back to my first love.  So here I am, and I'm gonna crush it.
